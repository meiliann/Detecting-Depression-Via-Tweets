once I get over my seasonal depression it is over for you hoes,1
My depression got really bad once and it caused me to lose my appetite for a little over a year. I lost a lot (and I mean A LOT) of weight. I got my appetite back though and when I began to gained my anxiety kicked in and I started doing anything I could to get lose it again :(,1
How I hate depression because of the pain it causes me but at the same time I still love it because of the realization it hits me.,1

"I always feel like it seems so fake to talk about my depression since it's seasonal, unlike clinical depression, but I just have to remember that the people who really matter to me will understand how fucking hard it is to live with any kind of depression, no matter what",1
Take me outta depression..,1
Depression is one of the worst conditions to have. Can never let you be happy. It controls your life. It makes you feel like nothing. When will it leave me alone,1
A similar thing happened to me when I was suffering major depression. Due to the fact that I might be well one day they would only give me sickness benefit for 6 weeks. Having to prove I was still ill was so stressful I nearly had a breakdown.,1
I wish I could beat depression how I beat my meat,1
Struggling with depression is a bitch,1
"I sometimes cry myself to sleep because, at night I get really low and depression.",1
I have cut off a lot of people for that but my friend turnover is really high now because of cutting off people and getting new friends. Depression is peak and im just tired now. I just want a bestie to reciprocate my energy and I'll be good.,1
"i cant stop my suicidal thoughts, depression, sadness, stress, emptiness. Want to kill myself.",1
"You see, the phrase ""everything happens for a reason"" really is true. One year ago today, depression and suicide ruled my life, inside and out. Despite the fact that I'd managed to hide my depression from family and friends, it is now known and it is getting better.",1
"I struggle letting myself ""feel out"" depression a lot. But when I do I always end up feeling myself let go of things I'm stressing over and it helps a lot. I hope that you guys are able to let yourself go sometimes. Let yourself cry and lay in bed. Sometimes we need it to feel ok",1
I was sitting in solitude. Depression came and kissed me. And my anxiety made sure that it would never leave me.,1
Some nights I don't sleep the depression gets da best of me рџ�©,1

"how annoying! I sometimes think depression waits until my guard is down like that. Bastard. I don't know how it works for you but i have to double all the things i know help (exercise, talking therapy etc) before it gets worse and convinces me not to do them.",1
"Someone told me that my depression and anxiety were a petty excuse for something, they told me that me being offended by people faking panic attacks is ridiculous and that I'm bitchy for talking about it. And apparently I'm in the wrong.",1
"Tbh i thought i couldn't be able to bear that depression and would definitely attempt something stupid , tried once or twice , just 16 days before and now im used to this anxiety",1

It is the same for people with major depression. I had to jump through so many hoops to prove I had a disability that I nearly had a complete breakdown. For an illness that getting out of bed & showering is often impossible. I hope it kills me sooner.,1
